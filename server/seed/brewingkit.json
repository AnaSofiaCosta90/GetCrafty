    "description": "Extra Pale Ale Malt is an excellent base malt for Brewers who require a low colour, well modified malt. The plump grains of UK two-row barley ensure uniformity and consistency, as well as good extract and enzymic activity. If you’re limited on base malt storage, Extra Pale Ale Malt doubles as a great light-coloured base for both Lagers and Ales."
